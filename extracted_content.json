  "text_content": "\n<h3>Product Ordering System Overview</h3>\n<p>Our product ordering system is designed to provide a seamless experience from purchase to delivery. Customers can browse through our catalog, add items to their cart, and place orders using a secure checkout process.</p>\n<h3>Inventory Management</h3>\n<p>Real-time inventory tracking ensures that product availability is always up-to-date. When a customer places an order, the system immediately checks inventory status to confirm whether the item is in stock. This reduces the chances of order delays or cancellations due to stockouts.</p>\n<h3>Payment Verification and Processing</h3>\n<p>Our platform supports multiple payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. Every transaction undergoes a validation check to ensure the payment method is legitimate and authorized. Invalid or declined cards automatically trigger a failed transaction response, notifying the customer to use an alternate payment method.</p>\n<h3>Order Validation and Fulfillment</h3>\n<p>Once an order is placed and payment is confirmed, the fulfillment process begins. The system generates a unique order ID, updates stock levels, and forwards the request to the logistics team for dispatch. Customers receive a confirmation email and tracking information for their shipment.</p>\n<h3>Delivery and Tracking</h3>\n<p>Orders are shipped via trusted courier services, with real-time tracking available through the user dashboard. Delivery times vary based on location, but our logistics algorithm optimizes routing to ensure timely arrival. Notifications are sent at key milestones, such as dispatch, out for delivery, and successful handover.</p>\n<h3>Order Cancellation Policy</h3>\n<p>Orders may be canceled automatically if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The product is no longer in stock at the time of processing</li>\n<li>The payment could not be verified</li>\n<li>The customer requests a cancellation before dispatch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All canceled orders are logged, and customers are refunded promptly through the original payment method.</p>\n<h2>Product Ordering System Documentation</h2>",
